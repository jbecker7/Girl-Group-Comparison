# Girl Group Comparison
Building on the silly, superfluous [GFriend Lyrics Frequency project](https://github.com/jbecker7/GFriend-Lyrics-Frequency) that I built yesterday, I decided to compare GFriend, Twice, and BlackPink. I also want to add some graphs via Matplotlib. Needless to say, I'm probably on the cutting edge of data-driven third-generation KPop girl group lyric comparison.
